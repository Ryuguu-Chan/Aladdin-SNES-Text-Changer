What is it?

It's a simple Aladdin SNES rom hacking tool that will edit the strings contained in the ROM binary<br/><br/>
How to use it

Here's a step by step

    Open the ROM (Aladdin SNES (USA)(NTCS)
    Choose the string to edit
    Edit the string
    Save the ROM
    Done

The commands

AB...YZ keys are for well....Alphabet

01...89 keys (numpad or not) are for numbers

But for symbols, you have to navigate through the internal symbol dictionary by using the up/down arrow key.

You can also use the SPACE bar for placing a blank space on the string

The ENTER (RETURN) key doesn't work yet, so you have to go through all the line with the left/right arrow keys in order to go to the next line
